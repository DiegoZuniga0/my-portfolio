      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am currently a Senior at the University of Indianapolis studying Electrical Engineering. I am a proud member of IEEE.</p>
      <p>During my time at UIndy, I’ve had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with circuits, embedded systems, and coding. I’ve worked with tools and languages such as C++, Verilog, FPGA development, and MATLAB.</p>
      <p>I’ve also collaborated with other engineers on semester-long projects that emphasized real-world problem solving, innovation, and teamwork.</p>
      <p>I’m passionate about my field and dedicated to turning ideas into reality through technology, design, and engineering.</p>
